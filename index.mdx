## ⚙️ Platform Overview

Agents Panel is organized around **four functional layers**, each responsible for a different part of the AI agent lifecycle.

## **1️⃣ Agent & Conversation Foundation**

### **🤖 Agents**

Agents define **who speaks and how they speak** on behalf of your organization.

Each agent includes:

- Voice identity (phone number)

- Persona and conversational behavior

- Recording consent and compliance settings

- Knowledge base (RAG) configuration

- Assignment to inbound or outbound usage

Agents act as the shared foundation for all calling and messaging workflows.

### **📝 Call Scripts**

Call Scripts define **what the agent says** during outbound conversations.

They allow teams to:

- Generate scripts using AI

- Edit and refine call flows

- Test scripts in real-time voice simulations

- Reuse vetted scripts across campaigns

Scripts ensure consistency and quality before any live calls are made.

---

## **2️⃣ Voice & Messaging Workflows**

### **☎️ Inbound**

Inbound handles calls initiated by customers.

It supports:

- Routing calls to the correct AI agent
