# WhatsApp Section – Workflow & Overview

## Purpose

The **WhatsApp section** allows organizations to **set up, manage, and monitor AI-powered WhatsApp voice and chat agents** from a single interface.

It serves as a no-code workspace where teams can connect WhatsApp numbers, define AI behavior, manage integrations, and review performance—without needing to configure external systems or write code.

This section enables both operational teams and administrators to deploy WhatsApp AI agents confidently and at scale.

## Core Responsibilities

Create and manage WhatsApp integrations

Define AI behavior for WhatsApp voice and chat agents

Maintain webhook and connection details

Monitor integration health and status

Review analytics and conversation history per WhatsApp number

Support audits, troubleshooting, and quality reviews

## Workflow:

### 1. Landing on the WhatsApp Section

When a user opens the **WhatsApp** section, a clear overview is presented, positioning this area as the command center for WhatsApp voice and chat agents.

From this screen, users can:

Create new WhatsApp integrations

View existing integrations

Monitor webhook status and connectivity

All actions are available without navigating away from the page.

### 2. Creating a New WhatsApp Integration

Clicking **Create Integration** opens a guided, step-by-step modal designed to simplify setup.

The creation flow includes:

(Optional) Connecting with Facebook to auto-populate WhatsApp business details

Providing a friendly business name for easy identification

Entering WhatsApp configuration details with inline guidance

Defining AI behavior, including:

Choosing an AI provider

Selecting text and voice models

Adding the AI API key

Writing the instruction that defines the agent’s persona and behavior

Once the form is completed and submitted:

A success notification confirms creation

The modal resets automatically

The integrations list refreshes to show the new WhatsApp number

### 3. Viewing & Managing Existing Integrations

All active WhatsApp integrations are displayed in a table view.

For each integration, users can easily see:

Business name

Phone number

Webhook URL and verify token

Current webhook status (such as pending or active)

Quick copy actions make it easy to reuse webhook details when needed.

### 4. Reviewing Integration Details

Clicking **View** on any integration opens a detailed summary modal.

This view provides a complete snapshot of:

Business information

WhatsApp configuration details

AI behavior and instructions

Webhook and connection status

This is especially useful for audits, reviews, or support investigations.

### 5. Editing an Integration

Selecting **Edit** reopens the integration form with all existing details prefilled.

From here, users can:

- Update WhatsApp credentials
- Rotate tokens when required
- Change phone numbers or business names
- Refine AI instructions or behavior

Only the modified fields need attention—unchanged details remain intact.

### 6. Removing an Integration

When an integration is no longer needed, it can be removed using the **Delete** option.

To prevent accidental removal:

- A confirmation step is required
- Clear messaging explains the impact of deletion
- Once confirmed, access is removed and the integration no longer appears in the list.

### 7. Viewing WhatsApp Analytics

Clicking on a WhatsApp phone number opens a dedicated analytics view for that line.

This analytics page allows users to:

- See high-level performance metrics at a glance
- Review completed and failed interactions
- Track average call duration
- Filters are available to narrow results by date range or call status, keeping analysis focused.

### 8. Reviewing Call History & Transcripts

Within the analytics view, a detailed call history table is available.

This table shows:

- Caller information
- Call status
- Duration and timestamps
- Each interaction provides access to conversation transcripts, making it easy to:
- Review agent behavior
- Troubleshoot issues
- Validate response quality
- Pagination and export-friendly views ensure large volumes of data remain manageable.

## Advantages & Design Rationale

- No-code setup for WhatsApp AI agents
- Guided forms reduce configuration errors
- Centralized visibility into all integrations
- Built-in analytics for monitoring and QA
- Safe editing and deletion workflows

## Summary

The **WhatsApp section** acts as a complete integration and monitoring hub for WhatsApp AI voice and chat agents.

It enables teams to:

- Connect WhatsApp numbers quickly
- Define and refine AI behavior
- Monitor integration health
- Review conversations and performance

By combining setup, management, and analytics into a single, intuitive workflow, the WhatsApp section empowers teams to operate WhatsApp AI agents confidently—without relying on technical expertise or external tooling.
