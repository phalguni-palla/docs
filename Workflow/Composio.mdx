# Composio Section – Workflow & Overview

## Purpose

The **Composio section** allows organizations to **connect external tools and services** (such as calendars, communication platforms, CRMs, and productivity apps) to their AI agents.

It acts as both a **discovery marketplace** and a **control center**, enabling teams to browse available integrations, connect them securely, and decide exactly what actions AI agents are allowed to perform.

This section ensures AI agents can interact with external systems in a controlled, auditable, and no-code manner.

## Core Responsibilities

- Discover available third-party toolkits
- Connect external services to the organization
- Control which actions AI agents can perform
- Monitor connection health and status
- Manage and remove integrations as needed
- Provide visibility into all connected tools

## Workflow:

### 1. Landing in the Composio Section

When the user opens the **Composio** section, the page is divided into two tabs:

- **Browse Toolkits** – for discovering new integrations
- **My Connections** – for managing already connected tools

A clear header explains that this area is used to connect and manage external integrations for AI agents, setting context immediately.

### 2. Browsing Available Toolkits

Under **Browse Toolkits**, users can explore all integrations available to their organization.

This view supports:

- Searching by toolkit name or description
- Filtering by categories such as communication, productivity, or CRM

Each toolkit card displays:

- The toolkit name and logo
- A short description
- Relevant categories
- Whether it is already connected

From here, users can inspect the toolkit further or begin the connection process.

### 3. Connecting a Toolkit

Clicking **Connect** on a toolkit opens a guided connection modal.

Within this flow:

- Available connection methods are presented clearly
- The user selects the preferred option and proceeds
- A secure sign-in flow opens to complete authorization

Once completed:

- The connection is created for the organization
- A success message confirms completion
- The toolkit appears under **My Connections**

This process requires no manual configuration and keeps the user within the product experience.

### 4. Managing Toolkit Actions

After a toolkit is connected, users can control what actions AI agents are allowed to perform.

Selecting **Manage Tools** opens a full-screen view listing all available actions for that toolkit.

From here, users can:

- Search for specific actions
- Select or deselect individual actions
- Bulk-enable or disable multiple actions

Saving these selections ensures AI agents only have access to approved and intended capabilities.

### 5. Reviewing Active Connections

Switching to the **My Connections** tab shows a complete list of connected toolkits.

For each connection, users can see:

- Connection status (active, pending, or failed)
- Date the connection was created
- Available quick actions

This view acts as a real-time inventory of all external tools linked to the organization.

### 6. Maintaining Connections

From the **My Connections** list, users can:

- Refresh a connection’s status if setup is still pending
- Review connection details
- Remove a connection when it is no longer needed

Deletion actions always require confirmation, preventing accidental removal.

### 7. Ongoing Visibility & Control

The Composio section provides continuous visibility into:

- Which external tools are connected
- What actions AI agents can perform
- Whether any connections need attention

This allows teams to manage integrations proactively without relying on engineering support.

## Advantages & Design Rationale

- No-code integration of external tools
- Clear separation between discovery and management
- Fine-grained control over AI permissions
- Centralized visibility into all connections
- Safe and reversible connection management

## Summary

The **Composio section** functions as both a marketplace and a control panel for external integrations in Agents Panel.

It allows teams to:

- Discover vetted toolkits
- Connect services securely
- Control how AI agents interact with external systems
- Monitor and manage integration health from one place

By combining guided setup, granular permissions, and ongoing visibility, the Composio section enables organizations to extend AI agent capabilities confidently—without technical overhead or complex configuration.
