## Purpose

The Login & Signup flow serves as the entry point into **Agents Panel**.\
It allows new users to create an organization workspace and existing users to securely access their dashboard.

This flow is designed to ensure:

- Fast onboarding for new teams
- Frictionless access for returning users
- Clear feedback during authentication
- Immediate readiness after login

## Core Responsibilities

- Allow new users to register and create an organization
- Authenticate returning users securely
- Establish an active user session
- Redirect users to the appropriate dashboard context
- Provide clear error and success feedback during authentication

## Workflow:

### 1. Accessing Login or Signup

When a user visits Agents Panel, they are presented with two public entry points:

- **Login** for existing users
- **Signup** for new users

All other areas of the platform remain inaccessible until authentication is completed.

### 2. Signing Up (New Users)

When a user opens the **Signup** page, a simple registration form is displayed.

The form collects:

- Full name
- Email address
- Organization name
- Contact number
- Password

Field labels and placeholders are written in clear, human-readable language to reduce confusion.

### 3. Completing Registration

After filling in the required details, the user submits the form.

At this stage:

- Input validation runs immediately
- Any missing or incorrect fields are highlighted inline
- Clear messages explain what needs to be corrected

On successful submission:

- The user account is created
- A new organization workspace is initialized
- The user is assigned administrative access
- A success message is shown
- The user is redirected to the **Login** page

This ensures every signup results in a fully usable workspace, not just a standalone user account.

### 4. Logging In (Returning Users)

The **Login** page presents a minimal interface with:

- Email
- Password

Additional navigation options include:

- **Forgot Password**
- **Create Account** (for users who reached login first)

### 5. Authentication and Access

When the user submits login credentials:

- The system verifies the details
- A loading indicator is shown during processing
- Errors appear inline if authentication fails

On successful login:

- The session is established
- User and organization context is loaded
- The user is redirected to the main dashboard

This transition is seamless and does not require additional setup steps.

### 6. Session Lifecycle

Once authenticated:

- The user remains logged in across page refreshes
- The platform restores the active workspace automatically
- All actions are performed within the authenticated session

When the user logs out:

- The session is cleared
- Access is revoked immediately
- The user is redirected back to the Login page

## Summary:

- **New users** can sign up once and immediately access a ready-to-use organization
- **Existing users** can log in quickly and resume work without reconfiguration
- Errors are visible, clear, and actionable
- Authentication never blocks users with technical complexity

This flow ensures that teams can move from first visit to active usage of Agents Panel with minimal friction and maximum clarity.
