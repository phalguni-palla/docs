# Settings Section – Workflow & Overview

## Purpose

The **Settings section** serves as the central control hub for managing an organization’s configuration, access, usage, and billing.

It brings together everything administrators and managers need to maintain the organization - security keys, team access, usage visibility, subscription details, and —within a single, structured interface.

The section is designed to provide clarity and control without requiring users to navigate multiple parts of the application.

## Core Responsibilities

- Manage organization-level settings and profile information
- Track credit usage and billing activity
- View all the transactions of the organization
- Manage subscription plans and upgrades
- Control API access and security keys
- Invite and manage team members and roles

## Workflow:

### 1. Opening the Settings Section

When the user opens **Settings**, a full-screen modal appears, organized into clearly labeled tabs.

- **General** – View and update your organization’s basic profile and contact information.
- **Usage** – Track credit consumption, remaining balance, and billing cycle status.
- **Transaction History** – Review a detailed log of credit usage, recharges, and allocations.
- **Manage Plan** – View your current subscription and initiate plan upgrades or downgrades.
- **API** – Manage AI provider keys required for voice and chat automations.
- **People** – Invite teammates, assign roles, and control access permissions.

All major administrative actions are accessible from this single location.

### 2. Updating General Organization Information

The **General** tab summarizes the organization’s profile details, such as:

- Organization name
- Contact email and phone number
- Billing address

Any information related to the organization can be viewed from here. Below this, there are KYC and Billing Address sections..

In the **KYC **section, the users can enter the PAN, GSTIN and CIN numbers and also upload their organization's documents for the KYC verification. Once the documents are revied, a **Verified **badge appears beside the organization name.\
\
In the **Billing Address **section, the organization's billing address can be added and edited when required which is used for generating the invoices for all the transactions.

### 3. Monitoring Usage & Credits Recharge

The **Usage** tab gives real-time visibility into credit consumption.

It displays:

- Current billing cycle and next renewal date
- Credits used versus credits remaining
- Separate tracking for subscription credits and add-on credits
- A quick **Credit Recharge** option is available for authorized users, allowing additional credits to be purchased instantly.
- This tab answers the key question:\
  **“How much usage do we have left?”**

### 4. Reviewing Transaction History

The **Transaction History** tab provides a detailed ledger of all credit-related activity.

Users can:

- View allocations, deductions, and recharges
- Search and filter by date, campaign, or transaction type
- Understand why and when credits were used
- This makes it easy to audit usage and trace specific activities.

### 5. Managing the Active Plan

The **Manage Plan** tab allows users to review and adjust the organization’s subscription.

From here, users can:

- See the current plan details
- Track subscription status
- Initiate upgrades or downgrades
- Clear messaging explains whether payment is required and whether a plan change is still processing.
- This tab provides a convenient way to manage subscriptions without leaving Settings.

### 6. Managing API Access & Security

The **API** tab displays the AI provider keys linked to the organization.

From this tab, users can:

- View whether required keys are present or missing
- Reveal existing keys when needed
- Replace or rotate keys safely

Clear indicators show if a key is missing, helping users understand whether inbound or outbound automations are ready to run.

### 7. Managing People & Roles

The **People** tab provides a complete view of all team members associated with the organization.

From this tab, users can:

- Invite new members
- Assign or change roles
- Remove access when needed
- Each role is clearly labeled, making it easy to understand what permissions each team member has.
- This helps maintain proper access control as teams grow or change.

## Advantages & Design Rationale

- Single, centralized location for all organizational controls
- Clear separation of settings into intuitive tabs
- Real-time visibility into usage and billing
- Simple role and permission management
- Immediate feedback for every action

## Summary

The **Settings section** functions as the operational cockpit for an organization in Agents Panel.

It allows teams to:

- Manage security and access
- Control team membership and roles
- Monitor credit usage and transactions
- Adjust subscription plans confidently
- Maintain phone number inventory

By centralizing all configuration and administrative workflows into a single, easy-to-navigate interface, the Settings section enables non-technical users to keep their organization running smoothly and securely.
