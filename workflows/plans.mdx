## Purpose

The **Plans section** allows organizations to **view and choose subscription plans** for using the platform.

It provides clear visibility into available plans, active subscriptions, included credits, and feature limits, helping users understand what their organization is entitled to and how billing changes affect usage.

The section also ensures that required prerequisites (such as KYC verification) are completed before a subscription can be activated.

## Core Responsibilities

- Display available subscription plans
- Highlight the organization’s current active plan
- Guide users through plan selection and purchase
- Support upgrades and downgrades between plans
- Provide clear feedback during billing-related actions

## Workflow:

### 1. Exploring Available Plans

When a user navigates to the **Plans** section, all available subscription plans are displayed in a clear, card-based layout.

Each plan card shows:

- Plan name
- Pricing details
- Included credits
- Key feature highlights
- Billing cycle

Users can quickly compare plans to understand which option best fits their organization’s needs.

### 2. Checking Organizational Readiness

Before a subscription can be purchased or changed, the Plans section checks whether the organization has completed the required verification steps.

If verification is pending:

- A clear message is shown explaining why checkout is unavailable
- The user is informed exactly what needs to be completed before proceeding
- This ensures there is no confusion about why a subscription action may be blocked.

### 3. Reviewing the Current Subscription

The currently active plan is clearly marked with a badge, making it easy to identify which plan the organization is using.

From the **Manage Plan** area in \*\*Settings \*\*section, users can view:

- Subscription status
- Billing cycle information
- Whether the plan is active or pending renewal

This helps users stay informed about their organization’s current billing state.

### 4. Choosing a New Plan

When a user selects a plan they wish to use, clicking **Buy Plan** initiates the selection process.

If the selected plan is already active, the action button is disabled.

Before proceeding, the system confirms that checkout is ready and then redirects the user for the payment using a payment gateway.

Once the payment is successful, the user is notified that the plan is being processed.\
As soon as the processing is done, the plan is shown as active and the credits are added to the organization's credit balance.

### 6. Handling Plan Upgrades

When upgrading to a higher-tier plan:

The user is guided through the payment flow

After payment, a short message explains that the plan update is being processed

Once complete, the subscription details refresh automatically to reflect the new plan.

### 7. Handling Plan Downgrades

When switching to a lower-tier plan:

No payment step is required

A confirmation message is displayed immediately

The active subscription is still the same as the downgrades are applicable from the next billing cycle.

This ensures the downgrade experience is simple and transparent.

### 8. Starting a Fresh Subscription

If the organization does not yet have an active subscription:

Clicking **Buy Plan** starts a new subscription flow

After successful payment, the new plan appears as active in the Plans section

This makes first-time onboarding smooth and guided.

### 9. Staying Informed Throughout the Process

Throughout all plan-related actions, the system provides clear feedback.

Users receive:

- Confirmation messages for successful actions
- Alerts when attention is required
- Automatic refresh of plan and subscription details
- This ensures the information shown is always accurate and up to date.

## Advantages & Design Rationale

- Clear visibility into pricing and features
- Guided subscription selection and management
- Strong safeguards around verification and billing
- Simple upgrade and downgrade experience
- Immediate feedback and status clarity

## Summary

The **Plans section** gives organizations full control over their subscription and billing experience.

It allows users to:

- Understand available plan options
- Confirm their current subscription status
- Upgrade or downgrade as needs change
- Manage plans with confidence and clarity

By presenting all plan-related actions in one place with clear guidance and feedback, the Plans section ensures organizations can manage subscriptions without confusion or guesswork.
