## Purpose

The **Phone Numbers section** is where organizations **view, rent, manage, and allocate phone numbers** used across inbound calls, outbound campaigns, and WhatsApp integrations.

This section supports both **self-serve number management for organizations** and **centralized inventory control for super admins**, ensuring phone numbers are sourced, assigned, and tracked in a controlled and transparent way.

## Core Responsibilities

- Provide visibility into owned and rented phone numbers
- Allow organizations to purchase Phone Numbers on rental basis
- Track pending number requests tied to subscription plans
- Ensure accurate ownership and usage visibility

## Role-Based Experience

The Phone Numbers section adapts automatically based on the user’s role.

## Workflow (Organization Users)

### 1. Viewing Assigned Phone Numbers

When an organization user opens the **Phone Numbers** page, a dashboard view is shown.

This view summarizes:

- Total phone numbers currently assigned to the organization
- Monthly spend related to phone numbers
- Available credits
- Any pending number requests being processed
- Below the summary, a list of assigned phone numbers is displayed.

Users can:

- Search or filter numbers by digits or country
- Review which numbers are currently active
- Release (unrent) numbers that are no longer needed

### 2. Purchasing New Phone Numbers

Clicking **Purchase Numbers** opens a guided purchase flow.

Within this flow:

- Available phone numbers are displayed
- Filters help narrow choices by prefix or pattern
- Users can select a number and proceed with purchase
- If the organization’s current plan already includes phone numbers:
- A clear banner explains that numbers are being fulfilled
- Duplicate purchases are prevented automatically
- Once the purchase is completed, the new number appears in the assigned list.

### 3. Managing Pending Requests

If a phone number request is still being processed:

- The status is clearly shown in the dashboard
- Users can see that the request is in progress
- This provides transparency without requiring follow-ups or support tickets.

## Workflow (Super Admins)

### 4. Purchasing Phone Numbers for the Bank

Super admins see additional controls when opening the **Phone Numbers** section.

From the **Purchase** view, admins can:

- Search available inventory by country, city, or pattern
- Select multiple phone numbers at once
- Bulk-purchase numbers into the central phone number bank
- This allows efficient sourcing of inventory for all organizations.

### 5. Managing the Phone Number Bank

The **Phone Number Bank** view displays all unassigned phone numbers owned by the company.

From here, super admins can:

- View purchase details for each number
- Assign numbers to organizations
- De-assign numbers when they are returned
- Assignments are performed through a guided selection flow, ensuring clear ownership tracking.

### 6. Handling Pending Requests

When an organization’s plan includes phone numbers that are not immediately available, a request appears in **Pending Requests**.

From this view, super admins can:

- Open a pending request
- Select phone numbers from the bank inventory
- Fulfill part or all of the requested quantity
- This ensures organizations receive the phone numbers their subscription guarantees.

## Ongoing Visibility & Control

At all times, the Phone Numbers section provides clear insight into:

- Which organization owns which phone numbers
- Which numbers are unassigned and available
- Which requests are still pending
- This prevents misallocation and ensures accurate auditing across the platform.

## Advantages & Design Rationale

- Clear separation between organization and admin workflows
- Self-service number management for organizations
- Centralized inventory control for administrators
- Transparent handling of pending requests
- Reduced dependency on manual coordination or support

## Summary

The **Phone Numbers section** acts as the inventory and allocation hub for all phone numbers in Agents Panel.

It enables:

- Organizations to manage phone numbers independently
- Administrators to source and distribute numbers centrally
- Clear tracking of ownership and usage across the platform

By combining role-aware views, guided workflows, and centralized visibility, the Phone Numbers section ensures phone number management remains simple, scalable, and auditable for everyone involved.
