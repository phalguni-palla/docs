## Purpose

The **Phone Numbers section** is where organizations **view, rent, manage, and allocate phone numbers** used across inbound calls, outbound campaigns, and WhatsApp integrations.

This section supports **self-serve number management for organizations**, ensuring phone numbers are sourced, assigned, and tracked in a controlled and transparent way.
This also supports the unrenting of numbers which are not required anymore from the same place.

## Core Responsibilities

- Provide visibility into owned and rented phone numbers
- Allow organizations to purchase Phone Numbers on rental basis
- Track pending number requests tied to subscription plans
- Ensure accurate ownership and usage visibility
- Allow organizations to unrent unwanted Phone Numbers


## Workflow

### 1. Viewing Assigned Phone Numbers

When an organization user opens the **Phone Numbers** page, a dashboard view is shown.

This view summarizes:

- Total phone numbers currently assigned to the organization
- Monthly spend related to phone numbers
- Available credits
- Any pending number requests being processed
- Below the summary, a list of assigned phone numbers is displayed.

Users can:

- Search or filter numbers by digits or country
- Review which numbers are currently active
- Release (unrent) numbers that are no longer needed

### 2. Purchasing New Phone Numbers

Clicking **Purchase Numbers** opens a guided purchase flow.

Within this flow:

- Available phone numbers are displayed
- Filters help narrow choices by prefix or pattern
- Users can select a number and proceed with purchase
- Duplicate purchases are prevented automatically
- Once the purchase is completed, the new number appears in the assigned list.

### 3. Managing Pending Requests

If a phone number request is still being processed:

- The status is clearly shown in the dashboard
- Users can see that the request is in progress
- This provides transparency without requiring follow-ups or support tickets.


## Advantages & Design Rationale

- Self-service number management for organizations
- Centralized inventory control
- Transparent handling of pending requests
- Reduced dependency on manual coordination or support

## Summary

The **Phone Numbers section** acts as the inventory and allocation hub for all phone numbers in Agents Panel.

It enables:

- Organizations to manage phone numbers independently
- Clear tracking of ownership and usage across the platform

By combining guided workflows, and centralized visibility, the Phone Numbers section ensures phone number management remains simple, scalable, and auditable for everyone involved.
