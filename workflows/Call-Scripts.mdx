# Call Scripts Module – Workflow & Overview

## Purpose

The **Call Scripts module** provides a workspace to create, refine, test, and manage AI call scripts that are used in outbound calling campaigns.

Call scripts define **what the AI agent says**, **how conversations flow**, and **how different responses are handled** during a call. These scripts are created in advance, reviewed, and reused across campaigns to ensure consistency and quality.

Saved scripts act as reusable conversation templates that can be selected when launching outbound campaigns, allowing teams to maintain a consistent tone, persona, and call structure.

## Core Responsibilities

- Create and manage call scripts for outbound agents
- Generate and regenerate scripts using AI assistance
- Edit and update script content over time
- Test scripts in a simulated voice environment before use
- Store approved scripts for reuse in campaigns
- Ensure campaigns use vetted and consistent call flows

## Workflow

### 1. Creating a Call Script

When a user navigates to the **Call Scripts** section, the script creation workspace is displayed.

The user begins by typing in the Script name and selecting an **outbound-assigned agent**, ensuring the script matches the correct persona and voice along with the desired language for the script.

The script creation form allows the user to define:

- Use case of the call
- Greeting style or opening message
- Conversation flow for interested responses
- Conversation flow for not-interested responses
- Additional instructions or context
- Feedback for regeneration 

After filling in these details, the user can generate a script using AI assistance. The generated script appears in the editor, where it can be reviewed and refined.

Once satisfied, saving the script stores it in the Call Scripts list and makes it available for future use.

### 2. Viewing & Selecting Saved Scripts

All previously created scripts are displayed in a sidebar which is **Saved Scripts **section within the Call Scripts module.

This list allows users to:

- View all saved scripts
- Select a script to open it in the editor
- Edit scripts if required
- Delete unwanted scripts

When a script is selected, its content is loaded into the editor, allowing further review or modification.

### 3. Editing an Existing Script

Saved scripts remain editable at any time.

When a script is opened in the editor, the user can:

- Modify the script content
- Update conversation flows
- Regenerate parts of the script with feedback
- Adjust metadata such as use case or language

After changes are made, saving the script updates the existing version so future campaigns use the latest content.

### 4. Regenerating Scripts with Feedback

If a script needs improvement, the regeneration option can be used.

In this flow:

- The user provides feedback or adjustments
- The script is regenerated using AI assistance
- The updated version replaces or refines the previous content

This allows quick iteration without rewriting scripts from scratch.

### 5. Realtime Script Testing

Before using a script in a live campaign, it can be tested using the built-in testing feature.

When the test option is triggered:

- A simulated call experience begins
- The user can speak and hear the AI agent respond
- The conversation follows the selected script and agent persona
- Both user and AI responses are displayed in sequence

If the user interrupts or speaks again, the AI adapts and continues the interaction naturally.

This testing experience closely mirrors real outbound calls, allowing scripts to be validated before any live dialing occurs.

### 6. Using Scripts in Outbound Campaigns

During outbound campaign creation, the Call Scripts module integrates directly into the workflow.

When a campaign is being configured:

- All saved scripts are available for selection
- Choosing a script automatically applies its content to the campaign
- Required script variables are highlighted and validated

This ensures campaigns cannot start without a complete and approved script, reducing errors during execution.

## Advantages & Design Rationale

- **Consistency**\
  Scripts are tied to specific agents, ensuring campaigns inherit the correct persona and tone.
- **Speed**\
  AI-assisted generation and regeneration reduce manual effort and iteration time.
- **Quality Assurance**\
  Built-in testing allows scripts to be reviewed and refined before reaching real contacts.
- **Safety & Control**\
  Only saved and approved scripts can be reused, preventing accidental use of drafts.
- **Scalability**\
  Scripts can be reused across multiple campaigns without duplication.

## Summary

The **Call Scripts module** is the content foundation for outbound calling in Agents Panel.

It allows teams to:

- Design structured call flows
- Test conversations in a realistic environment
- Reuse approved scripts across campaigns
- Maintain consistent AI behavior at scale

By separating script creation from campaign execution, the module ensures outbound calls are both **reliable** and **high-quality**, while allowing rapid iteration and improvement over time.
