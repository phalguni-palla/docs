## Purpose

The **Inbound module** enables organizations to handle **incoming customer calls using AI voice agents**.

It allows teams to assign agents to inbound use, route live calls to the correct agent, and monitor how inbound conversations perform over time.

The module ensures that inbound calls follow the same persona, behavior, and compliance rulesAG as defined in the Agents section, providing a consistent caller experience.

## Core Responsibilities

- Assign agents to handle inbound calls
- Route incoming calls to the correct AI agent
- Ensure recording consent and compliance are followed
- Capture and store call transcripts
- Provide analytics and insights for inbound calls
- Allow teams to monitor and manage inbound agents

## Workflow:

### 1. Assigning an Agent to Inbound

- The Inbound workflow begins by assigning an existing agent to handle inbound calls.
- When the user opens the **Inbound** section:
- The list of available agents is displayed
- Clicking on **Assign Agent** opens the assignment option
- A phone number (agent) is selected and assigned to Inbound
- Once assigned:
- The agent appears in the Inbound section
- The agent becomes available to receive incoming calls
- This step ensures only explicitly assigned agents handle inbound traffic.

### 2. Viewing Inbound Agents

All agents assigned to Inbound are displayed in the **Inbound** section.

This view allows users to:

- See all inbound-enabled agents at a glance
- Search for a specific agent
- Select an agent to view more details
- Selecting an agent opens that agent’s dashboard, making it the active inbound agent.

### 3. Managing an Inbound Agent

When an inbound agent is selected, the agent dashboard is displayed.

From this dashboard, users can:

- View call activity and performance metrics
- Inspect analytics related to inbound conversations
- Access the agent’s settings

Clicking the settings option opens the agent configuration panel, where the following details can be updated:

- Persona and conversational goal
- Persona and conversation goal
- Recording consent preference
- Knowledge-base (RAG) enablement
- Handoff number for escalation to a human
- Any changes made here immediately apply to future inbound calls.

### 4. Handling an Incoming Call

When a customer places a call to an inbound phone number:

- The call is routed to the assigned AI agent
- If recording is enabled, a consent message is played to the caller
- The AI agent answers the call and begins the conversation

During the call:

- The agent responds in real time using its configured persona and knowledge
- The conversation follows natural turn-taking
- The interaction feels like a live human conversation

### 5. Capturing Call Details & Insights

After the call ends:

- The call duration is recorded
- The full conversation transcript is stored
- Conversation insights are generated
- These details are automatically reflected in the agent’s dashboard, allowing teams to review and analyze inbound interactions.

### 6. Monitoring Inbound Performance

The Inbound module acts as an operations console for inbound activity.

From this section, teams can:

- Switch between different inbound agents
- Review historical inbound calls
- Analyze conversation quality and trends
- Adjust agent behavior based on insights
- This feedback loop helps continuously improve inbound call handling.

## Advantages & Design Rationale

- Clear separation between inbound and outbound agents
- Consistent AI behavior driven by agent configuration
- Built-in compliance through recording consent controls
- Immediate visibility into inbound performance
- Simple management without technical setup

## Summary

The **Inbound module** is the entry point for customer-initiated calls in Agents Panel.

It allows teams to:

- Assign AI agents to receive incoming calls
- Deliver consistent, compliant conversations
- Monitor call quality and outcomes
- Improve inbound experiences over time

By combining agent configuration, real-time conversations, and analytics in one place, the Inbound module enables organizations to confidently deploy AI-powered reception and support experiences at scale.
